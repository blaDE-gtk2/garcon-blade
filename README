What is it?
===========

This is pojk, a freedesktop.org compliant menu implementation based
on GLib and GIO. It was started as a complete rewrite of the former 
Xfce menu library called libxfce4menu, which, in contrast to pojk, 
was lacking menu merging features essential for loading menus modified 
with menu editors.


Current state
=============

Pojk covers almost every part of the menu specification except for
legacy menus and a few XML attributes. In contrast to 
libxfce4menu, it can also load menus modified with menu editors such
as Alacarte as menu merging is now supported. The only crucial 
feature still missing is monitoring menus and menu items for changes.
This is something that will be worked on for the next release.

The pojk API will most likely not be frozen until its 1.0.0 release!


Installation
============

The file 'INSTALL' contains generic installation instructions.


Debugging Support
=================

pojk currently supports three different levels of debugging support, 
which can be setup using the configure flag `--enable-debug' (check the output 
of `configure --help'):

  `yes'         This is the default for SVN snapshot builds. It adds all kinds
                of checks to the code, and is therefore likely to run slower.
                Use this for development of pojk and locating bugs in 
                pojk.

  `minimum'     This is the default for release builds. This is the recommended
                behaviour.

  `no'          Disables all sanity checks. Don't use this unless you know
                exactly what you do.


How to report bugs?
===================

Bugs should be reported to the Xfce bug tracking system 
(http://bugzilla.xfce.org, product Pojk). You will need to create an 
account for yourself.

Please read the HACKING file for information on where to send changes or 
bugfixes for this package.
